William's attempt at Front End Chitter Challenge (if you can call it that)

I only had a few hours this weekend due to being out all day and night Saturday and having family over Sunday, but either way it felt like this challenge would have taken me more than just a weekend. I picked this challenge as it was the area I felt I needed most work on, but quite frankly after 2 and a bit hours with it, I gave up, I clearly was totally lost and had no idea what the fudge I was supposed to be doing, this felt like such a colossal step up from the Notes in the week with the Emojis, now and entire bunch of methods had to be sent across and I didn't even know where to start. None of the resources were particularly helpful, and all in all I feel like I didn't really gain anything from even attempting this besides a migraine. This weekend challenge felt way too hard and overtuned to be attempted solo, and I am glad I only wasted a few hours on it, and not the whole weekend.

The instructions were not at all clear I felt, and having an API that completely covers the backend was completely new to me and I had literally no idea how to work with that. I just feel that the jump here is silly, we have had 5 days with 4 people over the week to build an app that does something as simple as post notes, and now in 2 days and alone, we are expected to build an app that has users, sign in/sign out, posts messages, replies AND likes? Even if all the backend is already written, that is a colossal step up, and one that I felt I had 0% chance of ever achieving alone on a weekend.

These weekend challenges have gone from taking up all weekend, but feeling rewarding when you complete them, to now just downright impossible and headache inducing, and personally I probably won't be spending any further weekends doing them, the weeks are rough enough as is, and my weekends would be better spent relaxing and refreshing my brain than being slammed against what feels like a brick wall. I will probably just resort to doing some chill Codewars over the weekends to stay sharp and leave it at that.


# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Utilities you might find useful

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
